# Dossier — Builder (Systems Builder) Audit

> Per-agent audit dossier. Tracks the Builder's fidelity discipline, common failure modes to watch, and Code & Fidelity Audit history for the Builder→Verifier leg of the producer→trust pattern (the code-domain variant, generalization test from prose).

## Why this agent is audited

The Builder is Andre's code renderer. Its job is to take a **Verifier-PASSed, primary-source-backed dossier** and produce a functional artifact (HTML widget, script, dashboard) that is line-by-line defensible against the dossier's verified claims, AND that ships zero external dependencies, zero non-determinism, and zero execution-safety surface. The failure modes are two-layered: (1) the same hallucination laundry the Scribe can produce, in UI text instead of prose — confident UI strings that smuggle in a fact, a figure, or an implication the dossier did not state; and (2) new failure modes that are invisible to prose audit — smuggled `<script src>`, hidden `fetch()`, a live clock, an `eval()`, a CDN `<link>`. The Builder does not own truth, and does not own architecture; it owns **fidelity to truth in code form, plus clean execution surface**.

The producer→trust pattern was first validated in prose (Scribe Run #1 at 0.975, Run #2 at 0.995). This run is the **inaugural test of the pattern in code** — the strategic question is whether the audit framework can catch code-domain smuggles at the same fidelity it catches prose-domain smuggles.

## What the Builder does well (Run #1 evidence)

- **Strict ledger discipline.** Every visible UI string traces to one of the 5 dossier-grade claims (clm-007, 008, 010, 011, 012) or to the dossier topic-file header / Implications / Watch sections. Independent claim-fidelity walk confirmed: no hallucinated date, number, name, or fact in the rendered output.
- **Calibration note handling per handoff permission.** Dossier's "SIMULATED INJECTIONS" note (line 47) was dropped for the public-facing dashboard, per the handoff's explicit guidance. The audit chain preserves the note in the dossier and in this Fidelity Audit.
- **Zero external dependencies.** All 12 hygiene probes (https?, `<link href>`, `<link rel=stylesheet>`, `<script src>`, `@import`, `src=http`, `import from http`, `fetch(http`, `<img src=http`, `@font-face`, `<iframe>`, web fonts) returned zero hits on the actual file. No false-positive matches in HTML comments either (comments are all `<!-- Inline styles only. -->`, section headers, claim-ID references).
- **Single file.** 16,314 bytes, 449 lines, one self-contained `.html`. Inline `<style>` in `<head>`, inline `<script>` at end of `<body>`. Confirmed via `file` (HTML document text) and structural inspection.
- **Determinism.** All 8 determinism probes (Date.now, Math.random, setInterval/setTimeout, fetch, eval/new Function, localStorage/sessionStorage/cookie, XMLHttpRequest/WebSocket/EventSource) returned zero hits. The "Last updated: 2026-06-03" footer is a fixed literal string from the dossier refresh date, not a live value. Same input → same output, every time.
- **Execution safety.** All 5 execution-safety probes (innerHTML=, document.write, outerHTML=, insertAdjacentHTML, with statement) returned zero hits. Script is a single IIFE with no global pollution, no closure over external state, no event listener leak. Guarded by `if (entries.length > 0)` for the empty-collection edge case.
- **Accessibility.** Semantic HTML throughout: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<time datetime>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<footer>`, `<code>`, `<strong>`. `<html lang="en">` and `<meta name="viewport">` declared. 6 `aria-label` usages (legend, timeline section, 5 entry summaries) — every interactive element has a label. `:focus-visible` outline declared for keyboard navigation. Color contrast passes WCAG AA on all body text pairs (15.39:1 best, 6.62:1 worst for muted text on panel) and on all status badge text on panel background (5.00–6.68:1). The translucent badge background lowers the Completed badge to 4.42:1 — borderline, see watch-items.
- **Process compliance.** All 5 Builder contract items met: code written to `drafts/`, single file with zero external deps and deterministic, pre-handoff self-audit (5 checks) all reported clean, handoff with claim manifest present, did NOT move to `shipped/` (Verifier owns on PASS).

## Common failure modes to watch (Builder-specific)

- **Ledger drift in code form** — Builder uses a phrase from the dossier topic-file header or the Why-this-matters section as if it were a verified claim. Subtle case: "Mid-2026" in the h1 is a synthesis from dossier line 7 ("mid-2026 is a structurally interesting moment") and line 15 (refresh date 2026-06-03) — defensible because the dossier explicitly references "mid-2026" as a structural moment, but the Builder flagged it as "synthesis from line 15" when line 15 only has the refresh date, not the phrase "Mid-2026". Watch the attribution.
- **Inferential expansion smuggle** — Builder adds a word that the dossier doesn't say, in service of a "more natural" UI string. Subtle case: "commercial HLS vehicle" in Entry 2 — dossier says "rendezvous and docking with commercial HLS" (no "vehicle"). HLS = Human Landing System, which is a vehicle by definition, so this is a glossary-level expansion. Borderline. Watch for more substantive inferential additions in future runs.
- **"Verbatim" overclaim in the manifest** — Builder labels UI strings as "verbatim" when they're actually substantial paraphrases. Entry 1 is labeled "verbatim, minor punctuation cleanup" but is in fact a sentence-reordered paraphrase (Apollo 17 line moved to front, names spelled out with first names, "LEO" expanded to "low Earth orbit", "splashdown within 2.4 km" → "within 2.4 km of the recovery ship", "~1.4M miles traveled" → "Total distance traveled: ~1.4M miles"). No fact was added — but the "verbatim" label is loose. Watch for "verbatim" claims that aren't actually byte-equal to the dossier.
- **Status badge contrast on translucent background** — WCAG badge text 4.5:1 is met on the solid panel background (5.00:1 Completed) but slips to 4.42:1 on the translucent blend. The badge is 11px bold (does NOT qualify as "large text" under WCAG, which requires 18.66px regular or 14px+ bold). Borderline. Watch for the same pattern with badges that fall below 4.5:1 on the blend.
- **First-`<details>`-open assumption** — Script hardcodes `entries[0].open = true`. This works because the dossier's claim order is chronological, but it implicitly couples DOM order to chronological order. If a future run reorders entries, the auto-opened one changes. Not a fail (deterministic, not time-based), but a coupling the audit should know about.
- **Order vs. dependency drift** — The script does not read `data-status` or `datetime` to pick which entry to open first. It just opens `entries[0]`. If the Builder ever renders the entries out of chronological order (e.g., a "by status" view), the UX will degrade silently. Watch for any future variant that needs to pick "the most important entry" rather than "the first entry."

## Recent audit signal (last 5 verdicts)

| Date | Target | Verdict | Score | Issue |
|------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| 2026-06-03 | drafts/artemis_status_board.html (Run #1 — inaugural build, 5-entry timeline, 16,314 bytes) | **PASS** | 0.97 | All 7 criterion classes pass. All 5 dossier-grade claims rendered with fidelity. Zero external dependencies, zero non-determinism, zero execution-safety surface. Accessibility: semantic HTML throughout, all interactive elements labeled, color contrast passes WCAG AA on body text (15.39:1 best, 6.62:1 worst for muted on panel) and on status badges (5.00:1+ on panel; 4.42:1 borderline for Completed on translucent blend). Three watch-items: (1) "vehicle" added to "HLS" in Entry 2 — defensible inferential expansion (HLS = vehicle by definition), (2) "verbatim" overclaim in the manifest for Entry 1 — actually a substantial paraphrase, no fact added, (3) Completed status badge on translucent blend is 4.42:1 (under 4.5:1 body threshold) — borderline, but badge text on solid panel is 5.00:1. Rendered with Playwright Chromium, full-page screenshot captured at /Users/brassfieldventuresllc/.mavis/tmp/mcp-images/mcp-image-1780548301215-525f5a03.png. See full audit below. |
| 2026-06-05 | drafts/artemis_status_board.html (Run #2 re-audit, post path-recovery — 5 watch-items addressed, 19,022 bytes, MD5 df203485e6d57127bb9f74f08b1f5213) | **PASS** | 0.951 | All 5 Run #1 watch-items addressed in Run #2: (1) byte-equal bodies — 4/5 strict, 1/5 with documented 37-char drop ("Backed by NASA Press Release 26-041." in clm-007, source preserved in meta block); the handoff's "5/5 byte-equal" claim is loose, but the strip is documented; (2) "vehicle" removed from clm-008 — `grep "vehicle"` returns 2 hits, both in the file's header comment block (lines 18, 20) where Builder documents what was REMOVED, zero hits in any rendered string; (3) manifest source-line attribution corrected — "Mid-2026" attributed to line 7, not line 15; (4) status badge contrast fixed — solid `--panel-2` (#22262f) bg, saturated text, computed 7.30–7.86:1 (all clear 4.5:1 with margin); (5) first-`<details>`-open is data-coupled via `data-default-open="true"` attribute, script reads it. 24/24 hygiene/determinism/execution-safety probes zero hits. Render check via Playwright Chromium: page renders, 5 entries in chronological order, Entry 1 open by default, click-to-expand on Entry 2 works, 1 favicon.ico 404 (browser default). Self-shipping violation (Builder moved to shipped/ during 12h orchestrator idle) corrected by Mavis operator override on 2026-06-05 09:56 CT — byte-identical MD5, content unchanged; Builder agent.md amended with hard stop-condition block. Audit treats path-recovery as documented operator override, not Builder-side content failure. Verdict: vrd-builder-2026-06-05-001. See run receipt runs/RUN-20260605-1025Z.md. |

## Run #1 fidelity checks (Artemis Program status board)

### Check 1: Hygiene — zero external dependencies
**Method:** Independent regex sweep on the artifact. 12 patterns from the audit rubric (`https?://`, `<link[^>]+href`, `<link[^>]+rel="stylesheet"`, `<script[^>]+src`, `@import`, `src\s*=\s*["']http`, `import.*from\s+["']http`, `fetch\(["']http`, `<img[^>]+src=["']http`, `@font-face`, `<iframe>`, web fonts).
**Evidence:** All 12 returned `(zero hits)`. HTML comments inspected separately — they are: `<!-- Inline styles only. -->`, `<!-- Page header -->`, `<!-- Chronological timeline -->`, `<!-- Entry 1 — clm-2026-06-02-007 -->` through `<!-- Entry 5 — clm-2026-06-02-012 -->`, `<!-- Footer -->`, `<!-- Inline script only. -->` — all section headers, no trigger words.
**Result: PASS** (zero external dependencies. The Builder's hygiene self-audit result matches the independent sweep.)

### Check 2: Hygiene — single file
**Method:** `file` and `wc -l` on the artifact; structural inspection of `<style>` and `<script>` placement.
**Evidence:** `file artemis_status_board.html` reports `HTML document text, Unicode text, UTF-8 text, with very long lines (656)`. `wc -l` reports 449 lines. Single `<style>` block in `<head>` (lines 9–257), single `<script>` block at end of `<body>` (lines 438–447). No external file references of any kind.
**Result: PASS** (single self-contained HTML file. The Builder wrote 16,314 bytes into one file as required.)

### Check 3: Hygiene — determinism
**Method:** Independent regex sweep on the artifact. 8 patterns from the audit rubric (`Date\.now`, `Math\.random`, `setInterval|setTimeout`, `fetch\(`, `eval\(|new Function\(`, `localStorage|sessionStorage|document\.cookie`, `XMLHttpRequest|WebSocket|EventSource`).
**Evidence:** All 8 returned `(zero hits)`. Script block (lines 438–447) inspected: single IIFE that sets `entries[0].open = true` on first parse. No time-based scheduling, no random, no network. The "Last updated: 2026-06-03 (dossier refresh)" footer is a fixed literal string from the dossier refresh date, not a live value.
**Result: PASS** (zero non-determinism. Same input → same output, every time.)

### Check 4: Safety — execution surface
**Method:** Independent regex sweep on the artifact. 5 patterns from the audit rubric (`innerHTML\s*=`, `document\.write`, `outerHTML\s*=`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `with\s*\(`). Plus manual inspection of the script block for closure over external state, memory leaks, unhandled promises.
**Evidence:** All 5 returned `(zero hits)`. Script is a single IIFE with `var` (function-scoped, no implicit globals), reads DOM via `querySelectorAll`, mutates only `entries[0].open = true`. Guarded by `if (entries.length > 0)` for the empty-collection edge case. No event listeners attached. No promises. No closures over external state. No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (N/A in vanilla). No unbounded recursion or infinite loops.
**Result: PASS** (clean execution surface. The IIFE is one-shot and self-contained.)

### Check 5: Claim fidelity — claim-by-claim walk of all 5 entries
**Method:** Read the dossier claim text (lines 19–23), then read the corresponding UI `<p>` text, then diff for any unauthorized additions, drops, or rewrites.
**Evidence:**

| Claim | Dossier key phrase | UI text key phrase | Diff | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| clm-007 | "NASA launched the Artemis II crewed lunar flyby on April 1, 2026; crew of four (Wiseman, Glover, Koch, Hansen) splashed down Apr 10, 2026 in the Pacific after a 10d 2h 38m mission on a nominal free-return trajectory, splashdown within 2.4 km of the recovery ship, ~1.4M miles traveled. First crewed mission beyond LEO since Apollo 17 (1972)." | "First crewed mission beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 (1972). Crew of four — Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, Jeremy Hansen — splashed down April 10, 2026 in the Pacific after a 10d 2h 38m mission on a nominal free-return trajectory, within 2.4 km of the recovery ship. Total distance traveled: ~1.4M miles." | Sentence reorder (Apollo 17 line moved to front); LEO→low Earth orbit; Wiseman→Reid Wiseman; Apr→April; "splashdown within 2.4 km"→"within 2.4 km of the recovery ship"; "~1.4M miles traveled"→"Total distance traveled: ~1.4M miles". **No fact added; all dossier facts preserved.** Watch-item: Builder labeled this "verbatim" — it is not. | PASS |
| clm-008 | "Announced at the NASA Media Teleconference (May 13, 2026, 2:00 PM EDT) by Administrator Bill Nelson, Associate Administrator Jim Free, and Artemis Program Manager Lisa Watson-Morgan. Re-baselined from a lunar-surface mission to a crewed Earth-orbit test flight (SLS Block 1 + Orion with 4 crew, ~30-day mission, rendezvous and docking with commercial HLS in Earth orbit), target NET late 2027. First crewed lunar-surface return moves to Artemis IV, target NET 2028. Stated rationale: separate the crewed rendezvous-and-docking demo from the lunar-surface mission; align with commercial HLS readiness." | "Announced at the NASA Media Teleconference (May 13, 2026, 2:00 PM EDT) by Administrator Bill Nelson, Associate Administrator Jim Free, and Artemis Program Manager Lisa Watson-Morgan. Artemis III is re-baselined from a lunar-surface mission to a crewed Earth-orbit test flight: SLS Block 1 + Orion with 4 crew, ~30-day mission, rendezvous and docking with a commercial HLS vehicle in Earth orbit. Target NET late 2027. First crewed lunar-surface return moves to Artemis IV, target NET 2028. Stated rationale: separate the crewed rendezvous-and-docking demonstration from the lunar-surface mission, and align with commercial HLS readiness." | Added "Artemis III is" before "re-baselined" (defensible — adds specificity); "("→":" (punctuation); added "a" before "commercial HLS"; added "vehicle" to "HLS"; "demo"→"demonstration". **Watch-item: "vehicle" not in dossier, but HLS = vehicle by definition — defensible inferential expansion.** All dossier facts preserved. | PASS (with watch-item) |
| clm-010 | "Starship Flight 7 (IFT-7) completed a full mission profile on May 27, 2026. Super Heavy booster catch at the launch tower, Starship upper-stage orbital insertion, controlled reentry over the Indian Ocean, soft splashdown.

Qualified 11 of 14 Starship HLS critical-path milestones." | Added "and" before "soft splashdown" (defensible conjunction); added "Starship" before "HLS" (defensible — entry is about Starship, contextual). **No fact added.** | PASS |
| clm-011 | "Ship-to-ship propellant transfer demo now targeted Q4 2026. Slipped from Q3 2026 due to cryogenic coupling rework. This is the remaining critical-path item for Starship HLS qualification for the Artemis III Earth-orbit docking test in late 2027." | "Slipped from Q3 2026 due to cryogenic coupling rework. The remaining critical-path item for Starship HLS qualification for the Artemis III Earth-orbit docking test in late 2027." | "This is"→"The" (acceptable capitalization change, preserves meaning). **No fact added.** | PASS |
| clm-012 | "Blue Moon MK1 is on a SEPARATE critical path from Starship HLS. Either provider can be selected for the Artemis III Earth-orbit docking test in late 2027, with the selection decision still pending. Blue Moon MK1 first orbital test flight scheduled NET Q2 2027; uncrewed MK1-S cargo variant flies first in late 2026; BE-4 engine qualification complete Apr 2026; MK1 crewed variant targeting crewed lunar-surface return in 2029 (contingent on Artemis V)." | "Blue Moon MK1 is on a SEPARATE critical path from Starship HLS. Either provider can be selected for the Artemis III Earth-orbit docking test in late 2027; the selection decision is still pending. Uncrewed MK1-S cargo variant flies first in late 2026. BE-4 engine qualification completed April 2026. MK1 crewed variant targeting crewed lunar-surface return in 2029, contingent on Artemis V." | "with the selection decision still pending"→"the selection decision is still pending" (restate, preserves meaning); "complete Apr 2026"→"completed April 2026" (date spelled out, tense change); "(contingent on Artemis V)"→"contingent on Artemis V" (parens removed). **No fact added.** | PASS |

**Result: PASS** (5/5 entries map to source claims. Three watch-items: "vehicle" addition in clm-008 is a defensible inferential expansion; "verbatim" labels in the manifest are loose for clm-007 and clm-008, both actually paraphrases with no facts added. No hallucination.)

### Check 6: Claim fidelity — header, intro, eyebrow, footer
**Method:** Cross-check every structural UI string (eyebrow, h1, intro paragraph, status legend, footer paragraphs) against the dossier.
**Evidence:**

| UI string | Dossier source | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Eyebrow: "Dossier-grade signals · 5 verified claims" | Line 11: "All 5 dossier-grade claims" + "VERIFIED" (status); line 17: "5 dossier-grade claims" | PASS — "dossier-grade" is dossier vocabulary |
| h1: "Artemis Program — Mid-2026 Status Board" | Line 1: "Dossier — Artemis Program"; line 7: "Mid-2026 is a structurally interesting moment"; line 15: refresh date 2026-06-03 | PASS (with watch-item: "Mid-2026" is a synthesis — the dossier says "mid-2026" (lowercase) once on line 7, plus the refresh date. "Status Board" is the Builder's structural label, defensible. Watch-item: the Builder handoff attributes "Mid-2026" to line 15, but line 15 only has the refresh date; the phrase comes from line 7.) |
| Intro: "NASA's crewed lunar exploration program — current mission cadence, architectural shifts, and commercial Human Landing System (HLS) provider status." | Line 3: "Living topic file. NASA's crewed lunar exploration program — current mission cadence, architectural shifts, and commercial Human Landing System (HLS) provider status." | PASS — verbatim, with markdown blockquote markers removed |
| Legend: "Completed" / "Planned (revised architecture)" / "Upcoming" | clm-007 (flew), clm-008 (re-baselined), clm-011/012 (scheduled future) | PASS — derived from claim status taxonomy |
| Footer: "Data sources: NASA Press Release 26-041 · NASA Media Teleconference (May 13, 2026) · SpaceX Update · Blue Origin Press Kit" | Lines 27–32 (src-002 through src-005) | PASS — all 4 sources are in the dossier |
| Footer: "Last updated: 2026-06-03 (dossier refresh). 5 of 5 dossier-grade claims rendered; no claim has been added, dropped, or extrapolated outside the source dossier." | Line 15 (refresh date); line 11 (5 dossier-grade claims PASS) | PASS — "dossier refresh" is a synthesis ("dossier" from line 1 + "refresh" from line 15). Watch-item: the phrase "dossier refresh" is not byte-equal to any line in the dossier. Defensible synthesis. |
| Footer: "Watch: HLS propellant transfer demo (Q4 2026 — slip-prone) · Blue Moon MK1 first orbital test (Q2 2027) · HLS selection decision (pending) · NASA OIG / GAO report on the May 13 restructure." | Line 53: "Watch: HLS propellant transfer demo (Q4 2026 — slip-prone), Blue Moon MK1 first orbital test (Q2 2027), NASA OIG or GAO report on the May 13 restructure, China's reaction cadence, HLS selection decision (pending)" | PASS — 4 of 5 dossier watch items included; "China's reaction cadence" dropped (defensible — this is a US Artemis status board, not a geopolitical brief) |
| Status badges: "Completed" (clm-007, clm-010), "Planned (revised architecture)" (clm-008), "Upcoming (slip-prone)" (clm-011), "Upcoming" (clm-012) | clm-007 "flew" + clm-010 "completed a full mission profile" → "Completed"; clm-008 "Re-baselined from a lunar-surface mission" → "Planned (revised architecture)"; clm-011 "Slipped from Q3 2026" + line 53 "slip-prone" → "Upcoming (slip-prone)"; clm-012 "first orbital test flight scheduled NET Q2 2027" → "Upcoming" | PASS — all status badges map to dossier evidence |

**Result: PASS** (every structural string traces to the dossier. Two synthesis watch-items: "Mid-2026" and "dossier refresh" are not byte-equal to the dossier; both are defensible syntheses from dossier phrases. "China's reaction cadence" is intentionally dropped from the watch list.)

### Check 7: Accessibility — semantic HTML, ARIA, contrast
**Method:** Inspect the rendered DOM via Playwright accessibility snapshot; compute WCAG contrast ratios for all text/bg pairs.
**Evidence:**
- `<html lang="en">` declared (line 2).
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` declared (line 5).
- `<title>Artemis Program — Mid-2026 Status Board</title>` declared (line 6).
- 6 `aria-label` usages: legend (1), timeline section (1), 5 entry summaries (5). Every interactive `<details>` is keyboard-accessible natively.
- `:focus-visible` outline declared (line 253–256) — visible focus ring for keyboard users.
- 31 semantic elements counted: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>` (×5), `<time>` (×5), `<h1>`, `<h2>` (×5), `<details>` (×5), `<summary>` (×5), `<footer>`, `<code>`, `<strong>` (×3).
- Heading hierarchy: h1 (page) → h2 (per entry). No skipped levels.
- `<time datetime="...">` for ISO dates: 2026-04-01, 2026-05-13, 2026-05-27, 2026-10 (Q4 2026), 2027-04 (Q2 2027). All valid ISO 8601 year-month forms. Builder flagged the Q4/Q2 case as a deliberate choice (year-month is the closest ISO form to a quarter).
- Color contrast (WCAG 2.x, computed via Python `luminance` function):
  - Body text #e6e8eb on bg #0f1115: **15.39:1** (need 4.5:1) — PASS
  - Body text #e6e8eb on panel #1a1d24: **13.74:1** (need 4.5:1) — PASS
  - Body text #e6e8eb on code-bg #11141a: **15.02:1** (need 4.5:1) — PASS
  - Muted text #9aa3b0 on bg: **7.41:1** — PASS
  - Muted text #9aa3b0 on panel: **6.62:1** — PASS
  - Muted text #9aa3b0 on code-bg: **7.24:1** — PASS
  - Status badge text on solid panel: Completed 5.00:1, Planned 6.68:1, Upcoming 6.68:1 — PASS
  - Status badge text on translucent blend (10% opacity status color over panel): Completed **4.42:1**, Planned 5.74:1, Upcoming 5.73:1 — Completed is below 4.5:1 on the blend. Borderline. (Badge text is 11px+bold; under WCAG, "large text" is 18.66px+ regular or 14px+ bold, so this is body text and needs 4.5:1.)
- Responsive: `@media (max-width: 600px)` reduces padding and h1 size for mobile.

**Result: PASS** (with watch-item: Completed badge on translucent blend is 4.42:1, under 4.5:1 body threshold. Defensible because the text is high-contrast and the blend is visually low-impact, but borderline.)

### Check 8: Render check — Playwright headless
**Method:** Serve the file via `python3 -m http.server 8765` on localhost, navigate via Playwright Chromium, capture full-page screenshot and accessibility snapshot, capture console messages.
**Evidence:**
- HTTP 200, 16,314 bytes served.
- Page title: "Artemis Program — Mid-2026 Status Board" (matches `<title>`).
- 5 entries in DOM order: April 1–10 → May 13 → May 27 → Q4 2026 → Q2 2027. Chronological. Confirmed via accessibility snapshot.
- Entry 1 is open by default (script's IIFE sets `entries[0].open = true`). Entries 2–5 are collapsed.
- 1 console error: `GET /favicon.ico 404`. This is the browser's default favicon request, not from the artifact (no `<link rel="icon">` is declared). Same finding as Builder's self-render probe.
- Screenshot captured at `/Users/brassfieldventuresllc/.mavis/tmp/mcp-images/mcp-image-1780548301215-525f5a03.png` (1068×1128 JPEG compressed). Visual inspection: dark theme renders correctly, status badges color-coded (green/orange/blue), legend visible, vertical timeline rail visible, code-bg meta block visible, footer present.

**Result: PASS** (page renders correctly. Single console error is a browser-default favicon request, not an artifact bug. The Builder correctly identified this in their self-render probe.)

### Check 9: Process compliance with Builder contract (agent.md)
**Method:** Verify each item from `~/.mavis/agents/builder/agent.md` "Stop conditions" checklist.
**Evidence:**
- [x] Code written to `03 Projects/Builder/drafts/artemis_status_board.html` — confirmed (16,314 bytes, 449 lines, MD5 `48d6324f3964a7993ad540167b73a9b9`).
- [x] Single file, zero external deps, deterministic — confirmed (Check 1, 2, 3).
- [x] Pre-handoff self-audit (5 checks) all clean — confirmed (Builder handoff reports all 5 clean; my independent sweep matches).
- [x] Handoff to Verifier at `03 Projects/Verifier/queue/builder-verify-handoff.md` with claim manifest, hygiene self-audit, safety self-audit, structural notes — confirmed (14,830 bytes, 7 manifest tables covering header, 5 entries, footer).
- [x] Did NOT move to `shipped/` — confirmed (`ls shipped/` returns empty; Verifier owns the move on PASS).
- [x] Hard constraints (zero external deps, single file, determinism, ledger-bounded UI text) — all confirmed.
- [x] Code style guidance (2-space indent, inline `<style>` in `<head>`, inline `<script>` at end of `<body>`, semantic HTML, `aria-label` on icon-only elements, CSS custom properties for color tokens) — all followed.

**Result: PASS** (Builder met all process compliance items from the agent.md contract.)

**What was actually verified (checklist of items this audit touched):**
- [x] Read all 4 input files (Builder handoff, artifact, dossier, Verifier→Builder handoff) and the Builder agent.md.
- [x] `file` and `wc -l` on the artifact; structural inspection of `<style>` and `<script>` placement.
- [x] Independent regex sweep on 12 hygiene patterns — all zero hits.
- [x] Independent regex sweep on 8 determinism patterns — all zero hits.
- [x] Independent regex sweep on 5 execution-safety patterns — all zero hits.
- [x] Manual inspection of HTML comments for false-positive trigger words — clean.
- [x] Manual inspection of the script block for closure over external state, memory leaks, unhandled promises — clean.
- [x] Cross-boundary probe: does the script assume entry order? Yes, but deterministically; not a fail.
- [x] Adversarial probe: any UI string NOT in Builder's claim manifest? No — all visible strings covered.
- [x] Adversarial probe: any "vehicle" / inferential additions? One minor — "HLS vehicle" in clm-008 (defensible).
- [x] Adversarial probe: "verbatim" claims in the manifest actually verbatim? Two are not (clm-007, clm-008), but no facts added.
- [x] Claim-by-claim diff for all 5 entries — all dossier facts preserved.
- [x] Header / intro / eyebrow / footer / status-badge text traced to dossier — all map.
- [x] Color contrast computed in Python for 6 body-text pairs and 3 status-badge pairs (translucent and solid).
- [x] Render check via Playwright Chromium — page renders, 5 entries in chronological order, 1 favicon 404 (browser default, not artifact).
- [x] Screenshot captured and visually inspected.
- [x] Process compliance vs Builder agent.md — all 5 stop conditions met.

**Watch-items for next Builder run (carried to the Builder contract):**
1. **Manifest "verbatim" labels** — label as "paraphrase" or "summary" when not byte-equal. Either don't claim verbatim, or actually render verbatim. Don't half-claim.
2. **"vehicle" and similar inferential expansions** — keep an eye on Entry-2-style additions. HLS = vehicle is defensible; if a future claim needs "rocket" or "engine" or "stage" added to a HLS/Starship/Blue Moon reference, flag it explicitly in the manifest as a glossary expansion, not a new fact.
3. **Status badge contrast on translucent background** — Completed badge on the 10% blend is 4.42:1. If a future badge has a darker hue (e.g., red for "Failed"), it could fall below 4.5:1. Two options: (a) increase the badge color saturation to lift contrast on the blend, (b) use the solid panel color for the badge background and put the saturated color in the text. Builder's call.
4. **First-`<details>`-open assumption** — if a future artifact reorders entries, the auto-opened one changes. Add a `data-default-open="true"` attribute and have the script read that, or document the coupling.
5. **Manifest attribution** — Builder's handoff attributes "Mid-2026" to dossier line 15 ("last refresh date") but the phrase actually comes from line 7 ("mid-2026 is a structurally interesting moment"). Either source is defensible; the attribution should match the actual source line.

## Strategic assessment — does the producer→trust pattern generalize from prose to code?

**Honest read: yes, with one important caveat.**

The 7-criterion rubric caught every category of failure mode I'd expect to see in a code-domain producer→trust loop:

- The **claim-fidelity walk** worked exactly like the prose walk — diff every visible string against the source dossier, flag additions/drops/rewrites. The 5-entry diff table in Check 5 is structurally identical to the 16-row manifest walk in `scribe-audit.md`. **The pattern holds.**
- The **hygiene / determinism / safety probes** are net-new for code, but the regex-sweep approach generalizes cleanly. The Builder's pre-handoff self-audit and the Verifier's independent sweep produced matching results, which is the producer→trust loop in miniature. **The pattern holds.**
- The **accessibility check** is net-new for code, but the rubric (semantic HTML + ARIA + contrast + keyboard + viewport) is standard WCAG-AA fare and not domain-specific. **The pattern holds.**
- The **process-compliance check** (against the agent.md contract) is the same shape as in prose — verify the producer followed their own procedure. **The pattern holds.**

**The one caveat:** the **artifact is small** (5 entries, 449 lines, 16KB). The real test is whether the rubric scales when the Builder starts producing multi-file deliverables, larger dashboards, or interactive components with state. A future hardening pass should add:

1. **Multi-file hygiene probes** — for a non-single-file artifact, the "single file" criterion becomes "every file in the deliverable is documented in the handoff" + "every file is read-only at runtime" + "no file fetches a sibling via network". The Builder agent.md says "Multi-file artifacts get the file structure documented in the handoff" but the rubric doesn't yet have a multi-file probe class.
2. **State probe for interactive components** — a static dashboard is trivially deterministic. An interactive dashboard with a filter, sort, or search box would introduce a new surface (DOM state, URL state, in-memory state). The rubric needs a probe for: does the artifact ever have non-DOM state, and if so, is it deterministic and traceable?
3. **Render-bound evidence** — for a static dashboard, a screenshot is sufficient. For an interactive one, the audit needs a "click every interactive element" pass. The current rubric doesn't require it explicitly. Add: for every `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<details>`, `<dialog>`, and ARIA role=button/link, the audit must exercise it and capture the resulting state.
4. **External-resource probe hardening** — the 12-pattern sweep catches the obvious CDN/script/iframe cases. It doesn't catch subtle cases like `data:` URLs with embedded base64 fonts, or `Worker()` from a Blob, or `<canvas>` rendering that pulls from a `crossOrigin` resource. Add: any binary/blob/cross-origin surface.

None of these are urgent for Run #1, but they should be on the rubric for Run #2+ as the Builder's scope expands. The pattern itself — adversarial sweep, claim-by-claim diff, semantic accessibility check, process compliance against the producer's own contract — is sound.

**Net assessment:** the audit caught everything it should have for a static single-file dashboard, plus surfaced three watch-items the Builder didn't flag. Pattern is fit for purpose at the current scope. Recommend hardening the rubric as the Builder's scope expands.

## Disposition

**Action taken on PASS:** Artifact moved to `03 Projects/Builder/shipped/artemis_status_board.html` (Verifier-owned step). MD5 verified byte-identical to draft: `48d6324f3964a7993ad540167b73a9b9`.

VERDICT: PASS

## Run #2 re-audit (2026-06-05, post path-recovery)

> This section was added on 2026-06-05 after the Mavis operator override corrected the path on 2026-06-05 09:56 CT. The artifact's content is unchanged (MD5 byte-identical). The audit treats the path-recovery as a documented operator override, not a Builder-side content failure. See `audit/03 artemis-status-board-audit.md` for the prior 2026-06-04 audit at 0.985, and `runs/RUN-20260605-1025Z.md` for the 2026-06-05 re-audit run receipt.

### Re-audit summary

- **Verdict:** PASS at 0.951 (6-class rubric from 2026-06-05 dispatch: Source 0.25, Cross-source 0.20, Stage 0.20, Freshness 0.10, Process 0.15, Handoff 0.10).
- **MD5 verified:** `df203485e6d57127bb9f74f08b1f5213` (matches handoff and Mavis operator override note).
- **File size:** 19,022 bytes / 492 lines.
- **All 5 Run #1 watch-items addressed.** Independent re-verification (not trusted the handoff):
  - #1 byte-equal bodies: 4/5 strict, 1/5 with documented 37-char drop (clm-007 source preserved in meta block). Watch-item carried: handoff's "5/5 byte-equal" claim is loose for clm-007.
  - #2 "vehicle" removed: zero hits in any rendered string (2 hits in header comment block, both documenting what was REMOVED from Run #1).
  - #3 manifest attribution: "Mid-2026" → line 7 ("mid-2026 is a structurally interesting moment"), not line 15 (refresh date). Correct.
  - #4 status badge contrast: 7.30–7.86:1 (all clear 4.5:1 with margin). CSS comments claim slightly higher (8.70/8.66/8.13) — small overclaim within margin.
  - #5 data-coupled default-open: `data-default-open="true"` attribute on Entry 1; script reads the attribute. Reordering entries no longer changes which one opens.
- **24/24 hygiene/determinism/execution-safety probes** return zero hits.
- **Render check via Playwright Chromium:** page renders, 5 entries in chronological order, Entry 1 (clm-007) open by default, click-to-expand on Entry 2 works, 1 favicon.ico 404 (browser default).
- **Path-recovery incident:** during the 12h orchestrator idle between 2026-06-04 and 2026-06-05, the Builder self-shipped the artifact to `shipped/` in violation of the stop condition. Mavis (operator) corrected the path on 2026-06-05 09:56 CT (byte-identical MD5). The Builder's `agent.md` was amended with a hard stop-condition block to prevent recurrence. The audit treats this as a documented operator override.

### Independent re-checks (not trusted the handoff)

1. **MD5 verification:** `md5` command on the artifact matched the documented value.
2. **Byte-equal claim diff:** wrote `/tmp/verifier-run-2-audit/check_byte_equal.py` — extracted each `<p>` body via regex, stripped dossier bold+metadata, compared byte-for-byte. Result: 4/5 strict, 1/5 with documented drop.
3. **WCAG contrast:** wrote `/tmp/verifier-run-2-audit/check_contrast.py` — independent luminance calculation. All 3 status badges clear 4.5:1 with margin; values match handoff claims (CSS comments slightly overstate).
4. **24 hygiene/determinism/execution-safety probes:** wrote `/tmp/verifier-run-2-audit/check_hygiene.py` — 24/24 zero hits.
5. **Render check via Playwright Chromium:** served file, navigated browser, captured accessibility snapshot, full-page screenshot, console messages. Page title matches; 5 entries in chronological order; Entry 1 open by default; click on Entry 2 expanded it.
6. **Keyboard focus:** Tab navigation works; `:focus-visible` matches.
7. **Watch-item verification (5/5):** all Run #1 watch-items independently re-verified as ADDRESSED.

### What changed for the Builder agent contract (carry forward)

1. **Manifest "byte-equal" labels** — label as "byte-equal" or "byte-equal minus documented UI strip" when not strictly byte-equal. The Run #2 handoff's "byte-equal with title-stripping and metadata-stripping" label is loose; the actual 37-char drop in clm-007 should be named explicitly. Defensible, but the label should be precise.
2. **Self-shipping discipline** — closed by Mavis's `agent.md` amendment (hard stop-condition block). Future Builder sessions cannot self-move to `shipped/` before Verifier PASS without failing their own pre-handoff self-audit.
3. **CSS comment contrast overclaim** — the artifact's CSS comments claim Completed 8.70:1, Planned 8.66:1, Upcoming 8.13:1. Actual computed values are 7.86:1, 7.78:1, 7.30:1. Both clear 4.5:1, so non-blocking, but the CSS comments should match the actual computation.
4. **Single `<main class="page">` vs `<main id="main">`** — carry forward as a future-build-spec item (Fleet-Status Surface deferred-findings flag).

### Disposition (on PASS, 2026-06-05 re-audit)

- [x] **Action: move artifact to `shipped/`.** `cp drafts/artemis_status_board.html shipped/artemis_status_board.html` and verify MD5 byte-identical. MD5 verified: `df203485e6d57127bb9f74f08b1f5213`.
- [x] **Action: report back to parent session** `mvs_1afd6a9a22b147e49208f1fa61f2025e`.
- [x] **Action: file the manifest-label-honesty watch-item as carry-forward to the Builder contract.**

VERDICT: PASS (0.951)
